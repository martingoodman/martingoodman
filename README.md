- 👋 Hi, I’m @martingoodman

- 👀 I’m interested in design and how to use technology to create healthier and more enjoyable spaces to live in. 

### My story so far ###
I have always had an interest in design from both arts and technical point of view. For example I studied fine art, Mathematics and Physics before starting my Mechanical Engineering degree. I love architecture as it marries technical, asthetic and cultural areas. Design for me is making choices alongside itterative cycles of testing your assumptions and mental model of the way the world is. I am extreamly curious and get stuck into all sorts of different areas.

During my degree course I would gate crash architectural shows and hang out with people studying arts.

In early 2000's Biomedical engineering was still in it's infancy and it fascinated me because it seemed mathematically challenging whilst intriging and human centred. I took a risk and completed a PhD in computational biomechanics (crazy when you think I was a Mechanical Engineer!). A few weeks after starting my supervisor announced she was moving to Glasgow. Nothing like a taste of independece, both exilerating and nerve racking at the same time. I became an Engineer in Glasgow University Mathematics department. During this time I found a few mathematical people had tried my PhD topic before, all quitting whilst leaving me some breadcrumbs to follow. I found the whole PhD processes uncomfortable to say the least, plagued by uncertainty and doubt. In summary I tell people, a PhD is quite unlike any other reserach or study, you do not complete a PhD, you survive it. Along the way your mental toughness is tested, along with your sanity and resilence. At the end I think you become comfortable not having all the answers, and a belief that you can pick up what you need as you go.

i love understanding things from thier basic concepts. I have found it's often missunderstanding or not grasping the essential concepts in an area means constantly skating on thin ice. It's very satisfying to grasp a core concept and be able to explain it with clarity. I seem to make alot of use of analogies, cooking seems to be a recurrent source of inspiration in this department. For example using toffee to explain plasticity, cookies as composites etc.



- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end web tools HTML5, CSS etc. I enjoy communicating technology ideas and figured better know something about how to put together digital content. After all it is 2021.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startup based around IOT, designing healhier spaces.
